# SampleJsonDataType
Sample of the automatic conversion of structures into a JSON message.

This sample illustrates how a data structure can be converted into a JSON message (and vice versa). 
In the conversion the layout of a structure is converted one-to-one into a corresponding JSON equivalent. 
Additional metadata can be created via PLC attributes on the member variables of the structure.
